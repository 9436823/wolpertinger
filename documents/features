exploration "base" behaviours


movement between tiles

eg. attribute sense of direction-> there is a slight chance, that in building the internal map 
a mistake is made, so that internal map and world map differ

player spells (EVENTS): "pings", placing flags, placing beacon to indirectly influence minion movement (trigger EVENTS the minion ki can react to, come here EVENTS)
Just a coarse, indirect kind of control
